# Hangman Game

Welcome to Hangman Game! It's a word-guessing game built with React, where your job is to guess the letters of a word before your attempts run out. Do not overthink it and get stressed, Chief Chimi(Me) got you covered with the setup instructions. Just follow these realy simple steps:

# What You Need

Before you start, you'll need a couple of things on your computer:

1. **Node.js and npm** (Node Package Manager)
   - Node.js runs the JavaScript on your machine, and npm helps you manage all the necessary libraries for the project.
   
   To check if you've got Node.js and npm installed, open your terminal and run these commands:
    node -v npm -v
    node --version as well to see what version of node it is.

If you don't have them installed, we can do that. Here's what we need to do:
- Head over to the Node.js download page (https://nodejs.org/) and get the lts version
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system Windows, macOS, or Linux.

2. **Git** (Optional but Recommended)
- Git is a tool that keeps track of changes in the project code. You can check if you already have it by running:


If it's not installed, just download it from (https://git-scm.com/), and follow the installation steps.

# How to Download and Set Up the Project

1. **Download the Code**
- You have two options to get the project files: you can either clone the repo with Git or just download a zip file.

**Option 1: Clone the repository with Git**
- Open the terminal and run this command:
  git clone https://github.com/chimezieokeke/HangMan.git

2. **Go to the Project Folder**
- Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the game.
  cd path/to/hangman-game
- Replace `path/to/hangman-game` with the actual path to the folder on your system.

3. **Install Dependencies**
- Now, let’s grab all the libraries and packages the game needs to run. In your terminal, run:
  npm install
- This will set up everything you need for the game.

## Running the Game

1. Start the Game Locally
- After installing all the dependencies, you’re ready to fire up the game! In the terminal, run:
  npm run start
- This will launch the game in your web browser (http://localhost:3000). You’ll be able to play the game there!

## How to Play

- **Input your name**: First, you'll be asked to enter your name to start the game.
- **Guess letters**: Try to guess the word by typing in one letter at a time.
- **Game over**: You win if you guess all the letters in the word before you run out of attempts. If you guess wrong too many times, it’s game over, and you’ll see the word.

## Troubleshooting

- **"npm command not found"**: Make sure Node.js and npm are installed properly.
- **Game not loading in browser**: Try closing and reopening the browser or run game on a different browser.
